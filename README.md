# Camera Capture Application

This is a simple camera capture application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows you to access your device's camera, display the video stream, and capture the current frame to a canvas when the "Capture" button is clicked.

## Features
- Access the device camera using `getUserMedia`.
- Display the live video feed in a video element.
- Capture the current video frame and display it on a canvas.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the application.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles camera access and the capture functionality.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure you have a working camera connected to your device.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
4. Allow the browser to access your camera.
5. The live video stream from your camera will be displayed.
6. Click the "Capture" button to take a snapshot of the current frame.

## Browser Support
This application should work in most modern browsers that support the `getUserMedia` API, including:
